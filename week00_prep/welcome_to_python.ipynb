    "  2. Look at the code. What do you expect the plot to look like when you run it?  \n",
    "        * **ANSWER**: i expect a figure with 2 linear lines, one of them dashed with axes named x and y and legends naming the 2 lines\n",
    "\n",
    "  3. Change the `y_parabola` variable so that, instead of calling `evaluate_line_list`, it calls your new function `evaluate_parabola_list`.  \n",
    "  4. Mess around with the parabola constants and see how the plot changes. Does the result make sense? What do you observe?  \n",
    "        * **ANSWER**: i observe how a parabola is made of the 2nd function. and changing the constant changes the properties of the parabola"
